ERROR in Z502Idle.  IDLE will wait forever since
there is no event that will cause an interrupt.
This occurs because when you decided to call 'Z502Idle'
there was an event waiting - but the event was triggered
too soon. Avoid this error by:
1. using   'ZCALL' instead of CALL for all routines between
   the event-check and Z502Idle
2. limiting the work or routines (like printouts) between
   the event-check and Z502Idle
PANIC: Because OS502 used hardware wrong.
Current time is 628

Record of Hardware Requests:

This is a history of the last events that were requested.  It
is a ring buffer so note that the times are not in order.

Column A: Time at which the OS made a request of the hardware.
Column B: Time at which the hardware was expected to give an
          interrupt.
Column C: The actual time at which the hardware caused an
          interrupt.  This should be the same or later than 
          Column B.  If this number is -1, then the event 
          occurred because the request was superceded by a 
          later event.
Column D: Device Type.  4 = Timer, 5... are disks 
Column E: Device Status.  0 indicates no error.  You should
          worry about anything that's not 0.
